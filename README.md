# Car Recommendation System

A Car Recommendation System built using machine learning to provide personalized car suggestions based on user preferences like budget, fuel type, and transmission. The system uses a clustering algorithm (KMeans) to categorize cars into different segments such as **Budget-Friendly**, **Mid-Range**, and **Luxury**. It then recommends cars that match the user's criteria.

## Features

- **Car Clustering**: Categorize cars into clusters like 'Budget-Friendly', 'Mid-Range', and 'Luxury' using KMeans clustering.
- **Price-Based Recommendations**: Get recommendations based on the user's budget.
- **Fuel Type & Transmission Filters**: Option to filter recommendations by fuel type and transmission type.
- **Data Visualizations**: Visualize car price distribution, fuel type distribution, and other data trends.
- **User Input**: Simple function to recommend cars based on user input (e.g., budget, fuel type, transmission).
